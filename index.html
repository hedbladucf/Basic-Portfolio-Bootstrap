				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="profile" class="profile-pic">

				<p>My name is Oscar Hedblad. I'm originally from Sweden, but moved
				to the US about six years ago to pursue a professional golf career. As professional golf is highly competitive, and I wasn't performing as good as I would've liked to; I decided to switch gears and focus on my degree.</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<p>I graduated UCF in the fall of 2014 with a BS in Computer Science, and have been working as a Java Selenium Developer since early 2015. Besides golf and CS, I'm a nature and music fanatic. I live and breathe for concerts, of which I've been to quite a few, including 11 music festivals. Along with my immense passion for wildlife and nature, comes traveling. So far, I've visited 19 different countries.</p>
